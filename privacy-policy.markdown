# ITA API Privacy Policy

This policy covers user privacy, system security, and International Trade Administration (ITA) information collection practices.

## Site Management Data

ITA Web servers automatically collect information for site management and for statistical purposes. Each computer system uses software programs to create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as assessing what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas.

## The use of "cookies"

ITA uses "persistent cookies" for customer login and preference tracking ONLY. No other use of persistent tracking technology is utilized.

## Consent to Voluntary Information Collection and Sharing

All the information users submit to ITA is done on a voluntary basis. When a user clicks the "Submit" button on any of the Web forms found on ITA's sites they are indicating voluntarily consent to the conditions outlined in this policy. We do not collect personally identifiable information (e.g., name, address, phone number, e-mail address) unless you provide it. In all cases, the information collected is used to respond to user inquiries or to provide services requested by our users.
