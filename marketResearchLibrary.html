<td> Many payments in commercial transactions are delayed or late, resulting in losses tobusinesses especially small-and-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). According to the EuropeanCommission (EC) this costs Europe 450,000 jobs and $32 billion every year.This report explains the rules and protection mechanisms introduced by Directive 2011/7/EUon combating late payment in commercial transactions that is designed to alter the latepayment culture in Europe. The Directive applies to all commercial transactions in business-tobusiness(B2B) and in public-authorities-to-business (PA2B) but does NOT apply to businessto-consumer (B2C) transactions. U.S. businesses should take this Directive into account for allthe contracts they sign that fall under a European country‰Ûªs law. </td>

<td> On May 14, 2013, the Brazilian National Petroleum Agency (ANP) held its 11th bid round for conventional oil exploratory blocks in Rio de Janeiro.  The round generated a record BR 2.8 billion (USD 1.4 billion) in signature bonuses and a guaranteed minimum of BR 7 billion (USD 3.5 billion) in new E&amp;P investment spending, which is expected to translate into substantial business opportunities for the suppliers of oil and gas equipment and services.  ANP declared the round a harbinger of the likely interest in upcoming pre-salt, conventional and non-conventional gas rounds.  National content regulations do not appear to have deterred interest in the 11th bid round. </td>

<td> The Government of Kenya released its 2013/2014 budget, which presents several opportunities for U.S. trade and investment.  The Kenyan economy remains resilient, growing at 4.6% in 2012 (up from 4.4% in 2011).  Projected growth for 2013 is now 5.8%, and is expected to rise to over 7% in the medium term.  Inflation has declined consistently over the past year, and is expected to remain within the 5 to 7% target range over.  Interest rates and the exchange rate are fairly stable and are expected to remain so going forward with appropriate macroeconomic policies.  Investor confidence in the Kenyan economy has improved further following the successful general elections.  Some of the sectors where there have been increased confidence in the business outlook include construction, telecommunication, mining, renewable energy, and long-term infrastructure projects in rail and ports.  However, low productivity in agriculture, a weak manufacturing sector and weak transport system remain major concerns. </td>

These measures were adopted in response to concerns about older used vehicles that were raised by local governments and private vehicle associations in Mexico, such as higher pollution generation, fuel efficiency limitations, higher maintenance costs, low mechanical conditions, reduction of new car sales, as well as the inherent difficulty in tracking and identifying older used vehicles involved in criminal actions or violations. The combination of these factors and others, forced the Mexican government to put in place some requirements to control the importation of older used vehicles. </td>

In addition to the U.S. government‰Ûªs facilitation of easier and faster visa service to Chinese travelers, the Chinese government has also announced a series of initiatives aimed at increasing travel among its citizens, which brings dramatic outbound tourism growth in the province and travel trade opportunities for American destinations and travel service providers. </td>

Yachting is predicted to become a popular recreational activity and will expand rapidly in the coming years, following in the footsteps of the auto market in China.

The main restriction on this growth will be the 43% tax on imported yachts.  The market will grow first through yacht-renting as most of China‰Ûªs growing middle class cannot afford high-end luxury boats.  Additionally, the Chinese government is working at various administrative levels to foster yachting as a complement to tourism. The policy support of Chinese government greatly promotes Chinese yacht industry. Through the development in recent years, Chinese yacht economy gradually becomes familiar to Chinese consumers. In the coming years, yachts will become an aquatic leisure activity and prosperous developing sport in China.

It is a member of the OECD (1996), NATO (1999) and the European Union (2004). Per capita income is nearly two-thirds that of the EU-27 average and total GDP is US$129 billion. The private sector accounts for more than 80 percent of GDP. Hungary‰Ûªs strategic location in Europe, access to EU markets, highly skilled and educated work-force, and sound infrastructure have led companies such as GE, Alcoa, Morgan Stanley, IBM and many others to locate facilities here, both in manufacturing and services. Currently, there are approximately 1800 partially owned and 128 wholly owned US companies operating in Hungary. Many of these companies find that Hungary‰Ûªs geographic position in Central Europe offers a strategic logistical hub within the region.Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Hungary has helped modernize industries, create jobs, boost exports and spur economic growth. Cumulative FDI stock has totaled more than US $92 billion since 1989. The key sectors are automotive, IT, electronics, logistics and, more recently, shared services (e.g. back office and/or call center operations). American companies have invested more than $9 billion in Hungary since 1989, making the U.S. the 4th-largest foreign investor behind Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. Meanwhile, U.S. exports to Hungary have topped US$1 billion dollars in each of the last five years, led by IT equipment, automotive components, industrial engines and other manufacturing technologies and supplies.For a complete listing of the most promising industries, please see Chapter 4, Leading Sectors for U.S. Export and Investment. </td>

The government, generally perceived as investment friendly, has enacted several regulatory reforms to simplify both foreign and local investment.  One of those reforms is constitutional and has created 47 new counties in Kenya similar to U.S. states.  Until recently, the franchise business model has been slow to take hold in Kenya because local investors know little or nothing about its potential rewards, industry insiders say; however, American franchises such as KFC and Naked Pizza have begun to pop up in Nairobi.  Given the establishment of the counties, investment prospects outside of Nairobi are likely to emerge in the coming years. </td>

<td> Composite materials emerged over a century ago and continue to be developed into a variety of new forms today. The variable nature of composites, with their vast range of applications, has led to the development of thousands of different products. Composites contain several advantageous characteristics that make them a practical choice for manufacturers across an array of disparate industries.  For instance, composites are four times lighter than steel and five times lighter than aluminum. This quality makes composites a key component for auto manufacturers and aircraft assemblers, as a reduction in weight can improve performance and result in significant savings in fuel costs. Additionally, by enabling complex shape design, composites can reduce the number of pieces needed to make a component, resulting in a savings in time and a reduction in the overall cost of production. Though composites can be used for a myriad of applications, they are particularly important to the transportation, defense, aerospace, construction, and wind energy industries. </td>

The U.S. remains the top destination for Taiwan students that want to study abroad.  The AIT Consular Section issued a total of 16,023 new student visas in 2011.  With Taiwan being accepted into the U.S. Visa Waiver Program in October 2012, it is expected that the market for short-term U.S. ESL programs will show strong growth in the near future.Taiwan is a stable and mature market for U.S. institutions.  Domestic supply of higher education has reached saturation point.  Going abroad to study is now more of a consumer‰Ûªs choice, with students becoming savvier and selecting programs that offer the best value for the time and money spent.   In recent years, career development programs or degree programs with work or internship components are becoming increasingly popular.  The market for Taiwanese students is very competitive.  Traditionally, the major recruiters are from English-speaking countries such as the UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.  In recent years, Asian neighboring countries like China, Japan and Singapore have stepped up efforts in recruiting top notch Taiwan students by offering scholarships or job incentives.  The U.S. still sits at the head of the class in attracting Taiwan students as it offers the best quality education and most choices.   U.S. schools should pursue deeper partnership with Taiwan institutions for student exchange or dual degree programs.  Engaging with student recruitment agencies and reaching out to potential students through fairs and social media are all recommended strategies. </td>

Architectural design projects around the country, from roads and stadiums to airports and retail space are abundant. Although there is strong competition from local firms, American ACE firms with a niche expertise are welcome to do business in Brazil, provided they understand the procedures for being able to work in Brazil. There are two general options for U.S. architectural firms to do business in Brazil.  The first possibility is for a U.S. architectural firm to partner with a local architectural firm that is licensed to provide architectural services in Brazil.  As with most services imported to Brazil, the Brazilian architectural firm using the design services will have to pay additional costs of up to 40% of the price of the services rendered.  To avoid this process, a U.S. firm may prefer to set up a business in Brazil directly and obtain the license to provide architectural services in Brazil. This option works for U.S. firms looking to do business in Brazil over the long-term, as starting a business in Brazil and obtaining the necessary approvals to do architectural work is not a short-term process.

Larger households withchildren are more likely to have a pet than those without, and most pet owners have only onepet. The most common pets are cats, which are to be found in over 20% of Austrianhouseholds. The number of cats in Austria is estimated at 1.5 million. The second most popularpet is the dog, of which there are approximately 581,000.

Based on market trends and previousresearch, we estimate the current market for pet products in retail trade to be around $700million. When the most recent survey was carried out in 2007, 27% of Austrians stated thatthey primarily purchased their pet foods at specialized retail (pet stores). The remaining 73%was purchased at supermarkets, drugstores, DIY stores and at veterinarian practices. Whilepet stores tend to be the first choice for pet supplies (around 70% of pet supplies arepurchased in specialized retail), 64% of pet food purchases are made in supermarkets. </td>

The NEI strategy and ways to strengthen interagency collaboration are outlined.  This survey covers Toronto‰Ûªs waterfront redevelopment plans, focusing on opportunities for U.S. exports.  The redevelopment of Toronto‰Ûªs waterfront along Lake Ontario is North America‰Ûªs largest urban renewal effort and one of the five largest in the world.  Encompassing almost 2000 acres of underdeveloped or redeveloped land spread over 34 sites, this project represents a projected cost of $30 billion of private and public funding to be spent over the next 25 years.  When finished, it will bring over 40,000 new housing units and an expected 4000 new permanent jobs to the area.  All developments built in Toronto‰Ûªs new ‰ÛÏBlue Edge‰Û will be mixed-use developments encompassing LEED green building standards, proximity to public transportation and an emphasis on environmental sustainability.   The export opportunities for U.S. firms to participate in this development are mainly in higher order services, including real estate development, architectural and engineering services, construction (especially focused on infrastructure or Public/Private Partnership management), and environmental cleanup, remediation and consulting.  Other opportunities exist for building suppliers and specialty material companies.  Participation in this waterfront development has hurdles for U.S. companies, including political uncertainty, regulatory restrictions, and a lack of certainty about future returns on investment. </td>

Political intervention, corruption, and central state control continue to obstruct most economic sectors.  The government is taking tentative steps to remove or amend restrictive trade and investment policies; however, it has yet to enact these changes through new legislation or make clear what regulations have changed or are still applicable.  The government tightly controls all official trade in goods, extractive industries, sources of capital, educational institutions, movement of labor, and access to official information. The country‰Ûªs abundant natural resources, however, have kept production in the extractive sectors on a generally upward path ‰ÛÒ though far below potential.  Production in historically strong sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, and forestry has been declining due to a combination of underinvestment, overexploitation and poor macroeconomic conditions including an exchange rate that has appreciated over 32 percent in nominal terms since March 2010. </td>

<td> Argentina has only recently started focusing on green building technologies, a concept that is still in the development stages.  Because energy efficiency is very low, an active role of construction industry and professional associations as well as government is required to increase the awareness of the advantages of green building in Argentina.   The slower acceptance of such technologies and services in Argentina has to do in part with the fact that for the past ten years the government has subsidized the cost of electricity and natural gas. This has made it less appealing and less cost-effective to incorporate green design and building practices, technologies and components.  The Argentine Government has recently taken measures to reduce energy subsidies and this is likely to increase market interest in energy conservation technologies and products. </td>

The country is densely populated and heavily industrialized. Roughly the size of Maryland, Belgium has a population of 10.9 million and a GDP (2010) of EUR 343 billion (USD 469 billion). This small European nation ranks as the 18th largest market for U.S. exported goods and services. Many U.S. firms choose Belgium as a hub for their European distribution because of its highly educated workforce and excellent logistics infrastructure, which includes major port terminal facilities, including Antwerp, the second largest port in Europe. In Flanders alone, 17% of all foreign firms are U.S. companies, and most are active in the medium to high technology sectors. Domestic gross electricity consumption has grown by an average of 1.7% per year over the last 10 years, reaching 91,590 GWh in 2010. Sources of electricity are nuclear power plants (53%), fossil fuel power plants (35.3%), pumped storage (1.6%), hydroelectric installations (1.1%) and renewable energy sources (9%). Policy instruments to develop renewable energies have been implemented over the last years, generally in the form of financial incentives. Since July 1, 2007, the liberalization of the European energy markets and imposed separation of distribution and production activities have also acted as a catalyst to reform the European energy sector through increased competition.  The result is strong growth in Belgium‰Ûªs renewable energy market. While European and Belgian federal policies have launched large-scale schemes, such as green-certificate trade, that target large utility companies and electricity distribution companies, the resulting financial incentives have led businesses to invest in renewable energy generation projects. Individual citizens are also encouraged, via important subsidies, to install alternative energy generators in their homes. The result is a broad demand base for renewable energy products and services on an industrial as well as a private residential scale.For the southern region of Wallonia alone, investments in alternative energy sources are estimated at EUR 850 million for the period of 2007 to 2012. Belgium delivers opportunities for U.S. firms offering energy-related products or services for industrial plants and home-based appliances alike. </td>

The Government of Japan (GOJ) regards the promotion of generics as a key political solution to reduce soaring healthcare costs from Japan‰Ûªs rapidly aging society.  As a result, in June 2007, the GOJ decided to increase the use of generics to at least 30 percent of all prescription drugs, on a volume basis, by Japan fiscal year (JFY) 2012 (ending March 2013).  As of JFY 2010, generics held a 23 percent share of the Japanese prescription drug market, on a volume basis, according to the Japan Generic Medicines Association (JGA).  It is not clear whether the GOJ will be able to achieve its goal of increasing in the share of generics to at least 30 percent, on a volume basis, by JFY 2012.  However, the Japanese market for generics is expected to increase as the GOJ will continue taking measures to promote the use of generics.

The use of generics in the Japanese market could accelerate due to patent expirations for a number of blockbuster branded drugs over the next few years.  Also, due to severe financial pressures on the GOJ, as a result of the Tohoku Pacific Earthquake (tsunami and nuclear accident) in March 2011, there may be a greater push to use generics in order to lessen national healthcare expenditures. </td>

This trend looks set to continue over our forecast period.Bulgaria&#39;s tourism industry is heavily concentrated in the Black Sea coastal resorts, where occupancy rates plunged dramatically in 2009.

The television broadcasting industry‰Ûªs growth in Korea has been erratic over the years, but Korea is now taking progressive steps to grow its indigenous digital broadcasting system.  There is a noticeable convergence between telecommunications and broadcasting as technology enables the delivery of content through multiple delivery platforms.  The broadcasting industry in Korea is moving to digital. The Electronics Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI) projects market demand for broadcasting equipment will increase to USD 2.06 billion in 2012 with the launch of new channels and government-sponsored digital content production support centers. The industry paradigm is shifting due to the acceleration of broadcasting digitalization, digital convergence, and the launching of new channels.  It will be necessary to increase investment in upgrading broadcasting systems as the competition between traditional broadcasting platforms, terrestrial TV, newly introduced platforms, cable TV, IPTV (internet protocol TV), satellite TV and HSDPA (high-speed downlink packet access) becomes fiercer.  As technologies evolve to deliver high density, two-way and 3D broadcasts, the lines between DVD, videos and TV products become more and more ambiguous.  As digitalization progresses and begins to enter the post-HD (high definition) era, the pictures provided by TV broadcasters have improved three dimensional effects and better resolution.  These are some of the more visible factors that will further blur the lines between broadcasting and the motion picture industry, which will affect future equipment needs.As the digitalization of broadcasting progresses through various media platforms such as smart phones, advanced set-top boxes and 3D TV, it is expected that digital content will also face a new environment.

<td> According to Japan Education Ministry statistics, 3,190 Japanese high school students studied abroad (three months or more) in 2008.  27,052 students went abroad for short-term (shorter than three months) study/training during the same year. Japanese high school students who go abroad are generally in their 1st or 2nd year of senior high school (equivalent to 10th and 11th graders in US) and many of them go on exchange programs.  For long-term study abroad (defined as 3 months or longer), the U.S. is by far the most popular destination, while Australia is the most popular destination for short-term programs.  With the Japanese yen getting stronger against the U.S. dollar in 2011, there are good prospect for U.S. institutions to recruit more Japanese high school students to their summer programs.  There is also a steady flow of Japanese students attending high schools abroad and graduating overseas in lieu of attending and graduating from high schools in Japan. </td>

Compared to other Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, Japan already has by far the highest number of certain types of medical capital equipment, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) units and computed tomography (CT) scanners.  Market demand for medical capital equipment, especially high-end medical capital equipment, is also supported by favorable changes in Japan‰Ûªs reimbursement pricing system for these products.  Japanese medical device companies have traditionally been strong in medical capital equipment; however, U.S. and foreign companies maintain a high share in some product segments.  Advanced diagnostic imaging equipment and other globally available sophisticated medical capital equipment that have not yet been introduced into the Japanese market should have good sales potential.    This market report on medical capital equipment will cover medical devices such as CT scanners, MRI units, nuclear medicine, and therapeutic systems. </td>

Nevertheless, the road to environmental convergence within the EU will be a long one.  As stated by the Polish Ministry of Regional Development, Poland‰Ûªs total financial commitment towards reaching the EU water and wastewater treatment standards within by 2015 amount to 15.5 billion Euro.   So far Poland has financed only 7.5 billion Euros on projects of this kind.  The Ministry of Environment confirms that the country will have to invest over 2 billion Euros annually until 2015 to meet the remaining EU environmental standards in the water and wastewater area.Over the past decade, water abstraction has decreased significantly; at the same time, there has been significant progress to connect both rural and urban populations to the water supply and sewage systems.  While the introduction of water metering, reduction of leakage, charging for water abstraction and wastewater discharges show signs of progress, surface water quality is still unsatisfactory and large investments in wastewater treatment plants have not lead to a corresponding improvement in surface water quality.  Major expenditures for water management infrastructure are necessary to ensure that water supply and wastewater related infrastructure comply with European directives.

The reexamination of old processes and the development of new ones in the past decade have made bioplastics suitable for a wider range of applications and generally more useable. Bioplastics have now passed from the research and development phase to the commercial production phase. There are two main concepts underlying bioplastics.

<td> The Colon Free Trade Zone (CFZ) offers a remarkable opportunity to U.S. companies in the consumer retail sector.  It is currently the world‰Ûªs second largest free trade zone ‰ÛÒ trailing Hong Kong ‰ÛÒ but is much more accessible for merchants from throughout Latin America.  In the CFZ, a U.S. exporter can sell to one merchant, duty free, and then expect to see his products distributed and retailed throughout Central America, the Caribbean, and the Andean region of South America as a result.The ideal U.S. company for this sort of model is one that is making a consumer retail item in the U.S. that already enjoys strong domestic sales to such mass merchants as Walgreen‰Ûªs, Target, or Wal-Mart.  However, the CFZ also enjoys strong sales in all areas of consumer retail, such as sporting goods, jewelry, perfumes, electronics, and clothing at all price points.  So if you were to imagine any consumer good, from a lower end item at a Wal-Mart to a higher end luxury item at a Neiman Marcus, you would probably be able to find it for sale in the CFZ. </td>

Because school trips are a part of a school‰Ûªs official curriculum, the demand for these trips is stable.  In 2010, 126,438 Japanese students were to travel abroad on a school trip.  This is only 4% of the number of students who were to travel on school trips that year.  Therefore, there is potential to expand the market for U.S. destinations if U.S, providers can offer attractive programs to the schools.High schools in Western Japan are quite active in participating in overseas school trips.  According to a survey by the Educational Tour Institute (ETI), 26.7% of high schools in the Kansai region organized overseas school trip in 2008.  (Note: for the purposes of this report, years will always refer to the Japanese school year which begins in April of the year noted and ends in March the following year). </td>

<td> The new EU Directive 2009/81 for defense and security procurement is set to challenge the way Member States currently purchase sensitive military and security equipment. The European Commission (EC) considers that such industrial compensation schemes such as offsets violate the principles of the EU Treaty.  EU Directive 2009/81 brings defense purchases under the rules of the Single Market and many offsets are set to become illegal, in particular indirect and non-military offsets. In contrast, the voluntary Code of Conduct on Offsets of the European Defense Agency addresses a different set of defense contracts procured outside the framework of Community law. This report analyses the legal justifications of the European Commission for its position on offsets and hints at its first legal actions in the area of defense contracts. It is important for U.S. firms to fully understand the implications of this new EU Directive with regard to the rights and obligations of procurement authorities in the EU.  Also, U.S. firms should be cognizant of the effects of the new Directive on their offset negotiations to ensure the compatibility of their offers with EU law. </td>

This semi-arid country slightly smaller than South Dakota has some of the best transportation, telecommunications and communication infrastructure in West Africa. Dakar, Senegal‰Ûªs capital city has become the transportation hub of West Africa region, with a number of airlines flying eastbound towards the other African countries and northbound to Northern Africa (Morocco and Tunisia), Europe and the United States. Delta and South African Airways ensure daily flights between the U.S. and Senegal. The Port of Dakar is the first major port-of-call from Europe and is well served by major shipping lines. The Port serves as an entrepot transshipment center for landlocked nations in West Africa. The Port of Dakar has deep draft at 11 meters and a wide access channel, which allows around-the-clock access.Many companies use Senegal as a regional center for their West Africa operations. With continued instability in Cote d‰ÛªIvoire, there has been some relocation of regional operations from Abidjan to Dakar over the past years. Senegal is one of Africa‰Ûªs most politically and economically stable countries. Since independence from France in 1960, Senegal has been a functioning democracy. Free and fair elections in 2000 brought President Abdoulaye Wade to power, ending 40 years of Socialist Party rule. He was re-elected on February 25, 2007.The Senegalese are generally well disposed towards Americans, and actively seek U.S. trade and investment. In the past, the country‰Ûªs historic ties to France and its relatively small domestic market have limited U.S. commercial relationships here, but that is changing, albeit slowly. U.S. investment in Senegal increased significantly in the late 1990s but has slowed since then. In 2010, U.S. exports to Senegal reached USD 217.7 million compared to USD 175.7 million in 2009. France, nonetheless, remains Senegal‰Ûªs largest trading partner, supplying approximately 16 percent of Senegal‰Ûªs import needs. </td>

<tr><td>Poland </td>
<td> The first ESCO project in Poland was initiated in the late 1990‰Ûªs.  At that time, ESCOs emerged in Poland, as well as in other new EU Member States, from engineering companies working in the energy sector.  The success of this market depended greatly (and still depends) upon the regulatory and financial situation of the marketplace.  In the 15 years since Hungary has become a regional frontrunner, Poland‰Ûªs ESCO development can still be categorized as in its infancy.  Poland‰Ûªs ESCO market size is estimated at approximately 6 -13 million US dollars annually. There are approximately 3 to 10 companies currently active on the market.  The majority of ESCO projects are aimed at developing heating in district public buildings and housing cooperatives. Some projects also deliver street lighting, insulation and complex retrofitting.  The economic condition of ESCO companies is still quite weak, mainly due to insufficient legal conditions, particularly in the public sector.  There is, however, a strong belief that ESCO companies may yet have a major role to play in the market as the state budget is very tight, lending strength to creative sources of capital for financing energy projects.  There is no reason to believe that the financing of energy efficiency projects through third party sources should not reach the same level of popularity in Poland as it currently enjoys in Western Europe. To enable this development, the Polish government will introduce, in the second half of 2011, a new Energy Efficiency Law that will create a tradable white certificates scheme for energy savings.  These certificates will become actual financial instruments for covering energy efficiency activities both in the public and private sectors.  Additional drivers for ESCO development should be observed within energy price increases, international and governmental funds now being reduced, energy efficiency programs, and continuing high energy usage in Poland as compared to Western Europe. </td>

In 2009 the industry increased 1.3 percent from 2008.  While it is smaller than other sectors, commercial fishing supports the livelihood of thousands of rural families. In addition, the Mexican government is investing $574 million pesos (46 million dollars) in several projects that include dredging, construction of breakwaters, fishing ports and wharfs.  From these projects 15,799 families will benefit from the fishing activity, according to the National Commission of Aquaculture and Fishing (CONAPESCA).The Mexican coasts offer many different types of fish.  The fishing industry includes fishing, processing, farming and packing. The country‰Ûªs fishing activities consist of deep-sea, inshore vessels, and aquaculture farms. The players within the industry include shipyards, Sociedades Cooperativas Pesqueras which are collective enterprises, aquaculture farms and private fishermen.  The Mexican states that contribute the most to the commercial fishing industry are Sonora, Baja California, Baja California Sur, Veracruz, Tamaulipas and Yucatan.The main species caught from Mexican waters are: shrimp, oysters, octopus, sardine, tuna and a variety of scale fish. Shrimp is the most important due to its value in the marketplace. 285,535 tons of shrimp were exported in 2009. The main importers of Mexican marine products are the United States who import 102,466 tons followed by Japan, Spain, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The purpose of this report is to briefly explain the commercial fishing industry in Mexico and identify the products and equipment used in this sector that have the most potential for U.S. companies. </td>

The IT industry in general in Colombia has enjoyed rapid growth in recent years on the back of new technologies and value added services.  Despite the economic downturn suffered in 2009, which affected developed economies and emerging markets such as Colombia, the IT sector has not suffered as much as other sectors of the economy. While GDP growth for the Colombian economy declined from 7.5% in 2007 to 2.5% in 2008, and 0.4% in 2009, the IT sector, maintained a healthy growth rate of 7.5 percent in 2009 (according to a report by Fedesoft), and is expected to present growth of 3.5% in 2010.  Overall investment in Information Technology and Communications (ICT) is expected to reach US$10,870.6 million in 2010, slightly up from US$10,521.7 million in 2009.

With a population of 2.5 million people, Sonora is one of the largest states in Mexico. It‰Ûªs the second largest cattle exporter in the country, following Chihuahua, in addition to being one of the top agricultural exporters and mining producers in the country.  It has 1,250 miles of railroad and 22, 500 miles of highway infrastructure.

<tr><td>Poland </td>
<td> Poland, the sixth largest country in the European Union with a population of 38 million people, represents one of the biggest health care markets in Central/Eastern Europe.  That stated, the health care sector in Poland has been in a somewhat challenging financial condition of late, and the short-term outlook remains tentative.  Since 1999, the health care sector has gone through several unsuccessful attempts at reform.  Each successive Polish Minister of Health has urgently tried to implement major changes to the existing Health Care Law to little effect.  It should be noted, however, that the current government and present Minister of Health are finally taking the official position that the health care system in Poland must be restructured to represent a mixture of both public and private initiatives.   Plans are also in the works to introduce new laws regarding private health care insurance.  It is expected that the current Parliament will pass some amendments to the existing Health Care Law and Regulations.  Once these new laws become the legal basis as established legislative reform, U.S. Commercial Service Warsaw foresees significant opportunities for U.S. companies in the health care/medical market.The main concerns are in the areas of restructuring, privatization, transparency in treatment standards, and control of the reimbursement system.  The traditional public health care sector needs investment and management skills to meet the growing demand from patients and at the same time remain within cost controls.  The limited resources of state funds make it even more important to attract private sponsors.  One way to cure the ills of the Polish system is to open the market for private investors and private health care insurance institutions.These continuing issues heavily influence the purchase of medical supplies in general.  In addition, operational financing is limited in Poland, even among the larger, more successful Polish distributors in the medical sector.  Price is the main factor considered by all buyers of medical products in Poland.  Quality is usually the next element considered.  Investment related purchases, such as advanced medical equipment like mammography equipment, EEG equipment, Magnetic Resonance Imaging units, radiography/tomography Units, X-ray equipment, etc., are usually limited to private clinics.  Fortunately, this market niche is rapidly growing, with an average annual growth rate estimated at 20-30% in 2008, while larger private firms grew even faster (30-40%).  On the other hand, due to the global economic crisis, in 2009 the annual growth in private medical sector was estimated at only 6-7%.     In general, American suppliers of medical products have a good reputation for high quality products.  However, technological advantage is not the only factor determining success in the Polish market.  Therefore, American companies should focus on educating end-users and other players in the health care sector.   A successful exporter should strongly support its agent/representative at medical seminars and conferences.  Participation at conferences and seminars is a very effective avenue for promotion in Poland.  American health care management and health insurance institutions are also known to have a long history of operating in highly competitive environments and are established as having strong expertise in private health insurance and plans.  The new Polish health care market should present American companies in this sector with good opportunities. </td>

Hungary received the highest score in a survey conducted by Buck Consultants International in 2009 comparing the Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, Romania and the U.K. concerning labor costs and availability, patent population, infrastructure, regulatory framework, business climate and accessibility. The CenterWatch Monthly, 2008 August revealed that some cost advantages still existed as compared with Western countries (not more than 10-15%) but there are several other good reasons why a large number of pharmaceutical and biotech companies come to Hungary and Central‰ÛÒEastern Europe (CEE) to conduct clinical trials.  The number of global clinical trials initiated in CEE more than tripled from 2002 through 2007 and approached 3,000 trials per year in 2007.All leading global Clinical Research Organizations (CROs) and Site Management Organizations (SMOs) have offices in Hungary, including Covance, PPD, Quintiles, Parexel, ICON, i3, Kendle ,PRA, Pharmanet and Synexus. A Hungarian-based regional CRO, Goodwill Research Ltd. was acquired by Pierrel, an international CRO. Regional clinical CROs with headquarters in Hungary are ideal partners to manage CEE regional trials. The national CRO industry has its national growth drivers, too. Hungary‰Ûªs national pharmaceutical industry provides a wide source of accumulated knowledge in chemistry and biology.  Hungary has over 70 enterprises focusing their activity on biotechnology-related R&amp;D or manufacturing.  In addition, there is a vast presence of large international pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies investing not only in sales and marketing but in local early and late stage R&amp;D as well as manufacturing. (source:  Convincive Consulting and ITD Hungary)According to a survey conducted by the Clinical Trial Management Society in Hungary and the Hungarian Health Economic Association in 2008, the Hungarian health care system generated USD 52-56 million revenue from clinical trials.

In December 2008, the Council of EU Foreign Affairs Ministers approved the ‰ÛÏCommon Position‰Û 2008/944 making the 1998 EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports legally binding. Every request for an arms export license for an item referenced in the EU Common Military List will have to be assessed according to the eight criteria outlined in the new Common Rules. The new Common Position also creates a mechanism among EU Member States to consult and inform each other about denials of arms export and brokering licenses. The new Common Position only concerns exports of military items outside the EU. The most important expected impact is a better alignment of policies of EU Member States regarding the consistent and common application of U.N., EU and OSCE arms embargoes and other international export restrictions. The combination of these new rules that govern both internal transfers and external exports aim at creating higher standards for a more coherent and harmonized European defense market. US exporters should be aware of the changing environment in the EU that this decision triggers in arms export control policy. </td>

<td> The sub-sector of interior textiles that includes carpets, upholstery and furnishing fabrics, household linens, decorative fabrics, mattress ticking, and trimmings, represents the largest sub-sector of the textile industry in Belgium.  In recent years, the number of furniture and interior textile imports into Belgium has increased, adding to the country‰Ûªs trade deficit. Amidst a very competitive market, Belgian textile producers, wholesalers, and consumers all place a strong emphasis on style and performance and are willing to pay higher prices for better-quality fabrics with special features.  Imports from low-wage countries such as China, Turkey, and India, among those steadily increasing, dominate the market, while the number of imports from other Western European countries has remained stable.  Despite the competitiveness of Belgium‰Ûªs market, there are still opportunities for American companies to infiltrate niche markets, particularly in home textiles and high-end fabrics.  In addition to the favorable Euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate, reputable technology and production techniques also allow American manufacturers to be competitive in the Belgian market. </td>

Since 2002, U.S. exports of environmental technology to its Top 20 destinations have grown over 50%, keeping pace with the overall growth of the global market.  Exports to Belgium have likewise kept pace with this global growth rate.  By year-end 2006, U.S. environmental exports to Belgium stood at over $472 million, generally following this breakdown:  40% water/wastewater, 30% air pollution control, and 24% solid waste and recycling.  Exports included products, chemicals and supplies, as well as services like consulting and engineering.Both the Belgium federal government as well as the regional authorities regulate air pollution control.  The Federal government is primarily responsible for mobile sources (cars, trucks, etc) and for climate change issues related to Belgium‰Ûªs responsibilities under EU commitments to the Kyoto Protocol.  The regional authorities for Wallonia, Flanders and Brussels set controls and are the licensing and permitting authorities for stationary sources of emissions.  Like the U.S., though, while the governmental authorities set the standards, there is strict adherence to the ‰ÛÏpolluter pays‰Û principle so private parties are responsible for all costs to achieve compliance with the limits of their licenses and permits. </td>

<td> Because Belgium is a small and densely populated country, waste collection, treatment and disposal services are highly developed and sophisticated. The waste treatment market in Belgium is mature and hyper-competitive among six mostly multinational waste management groups.  While to date municipal waste has been handled by the public sector and industrial waste by private firms, the landscape is changing.  Typically public services are now being considered for privatization.  Waste handling and treatment is no exception.  This of course could have significant implications for supplying product and services to this sector.Most waste treatment equipment is imported from neighboring countries. Although the Belgian waste management market is mature, market opportunities do exist in certain niche areas. As the EU sets out new recycling targets for existing legislation and new legislation for additional waste streams, the Belgian waste management market will demand additional equipment and/or new technologies able to sort and recycle new waste streams and components.U.S. firms may be competitive in an increasingly international waste market if they can provide innovative and cost and labor saving equipment, technologies, or services that will enable local recyclers to technically improve their operations, thereby saving time and labor costs, to cope with a rapidly expanding market. Additionally, opportunities exist for creating new markets for recycled materials. </td>

<td> Turkey:  Top Court Foils Justice and Development Party‰Ûªs (AKP) Plans to Boost Imam Hatip SchoolsImam Hatip plan fails:  The Council of State has partially agreed with objections by YOK, Turkey‰Ûªs Council of Higher Education, and has suspended a law that would have allowed Imam Hatip (Koranic high school) graduates to obtain a normal high school diploma in addition to their religious one, and thus escape coefficient cuts in their university exam scores.  Religious high schools in Turkey are tasked by law to raise preachers and other Muslim clergy, but many regard them as a breeding ground for Islamist political movements.YOK, which oversees Turkish universities, welcomed the suspension of the decree, seen as a first step towards its cancellation.  YOK Deputy Chairman, Isa Esme, stated:  ‰ÛÏThey (AKP) expected this decision.‰Û  YOK had argued that the law encouraged students to attend religious schools and thus breached ‰ÛÏthe principal of secularism outlined as one of the republic‰Ûªs unchangeable attributes in the Constitution.‰ÛEducation is a key focal point for the increasingly strident duel that pits the religious-oriented Justice and Development (AKP) Party against the defenders of Turkey‰Ûªs secularist traditions.  The AKP Party is widely suspected of trying to use the Imam Hatip  high schools as a feeder system to develop loyal cadres within the federal bureaucracy.  This explains AKP‰Ûªs repeated attempts to make it easier for Imam Hatip graduates to gain access to non-theological curricula at universities without being penalized by a coefficient system that currently discounts their religious education.  YOK, Turkey‰Ûªs Council of Higher Education, has been a kernel of secularist opposition to AKP‰Ûªs attempts at education ‰ÛÏreform.‰Û      The ending of the coefficient system that Imam Hatip graduates are subject to was of the main campaign promises of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), but its repeated efforts to change the system have failed over the past three years.  The law drafted by the Educational Ministry would have allowed Imam Hatip graduates to receive a normal high school diploma in addition to the one they received from their religious school.  This would have saved them from point deductions on the university exam.Principal with Headscarf ‰ÛÏInappropriate:‰Û  In a separate but related issue, the Council of State‰Ûªs Second Bureau has decided that it is  inappropriate for a teacher who wears a headscarf  while commuting to school to be appointed as a principal.  The bureau said that teachers must set an example to their pupils and refrain from conduct considered illegal by regulations even when not at work.The teacher in the case was removed as the principal of a nursery school when she attempted to enter the school by showing an identification care showing her with her head covered.  The teacher, who had been disciplined twice before, filed a complaint and won her case, but on appeal, the court‰Ûªs decision was reversed.  The bureau noted the teacher had been the principal of a nursery school where pupils were not mature enough to understand the nature of the problem.For more information on the Turkish educational sector, please contact:U.S. Commercial ServiceIstanbul, TurkeyInci Ciloglu, Commercial SpecialistTel:  [90] (212) 335-9197Fax:  [90] (212) 335-9103E-Mail:  Inci.Ciloglu@mail.doc.govVisit www.csturkey.com - www.BuyUSA.gov </td>

<td> TURKEY ‰ÛÒ WORLD BANK:  TURKISH EDUCATION FAILING YOUTHA World Bank report slammed the Turkish educational system, arguing that it fulfilled its mission adequately for only a fraction of the student population, leaving the remainder of youngsters behind.  It proposed that compulsory secondary school education be phased in, along with an overhaul of the university entrance examinations.The report, the result of education reform efforts in cooperation with the Turkish Education Ministry, Financial Ministry, State Planning Organization (DPT) and the Turkish Statistics Institute (TUIK), assesses Turkey‰Ûªs secondary education system.World Bank experts drafted the report on the current state of the secondary school system and offered recommendations.  The report said Turkey had made significant progress in education in recent years, noting that such progress manifested itself with the improving quality of educational opportunities, students winning international awards, and serious support given to education by the private sector.However, despite the progress made, the report said, there were still serious shortcomings in the educational system.What‰Ûªs Wrong:  The report noted that Turkey did not abide by international norms when it came to education, particularly with regard to preschool. ‰ÛÏThe proportion of children between the ages of 3-5 receiving formal schooling is 100 percent in France, 95 percent in Luxemburg, 80 percent in Denmark and Japan, 60 percent in Bulgaria, between 30 and 35 percent in Morocco, 20 percent in Georgia and Indonesia, but only 15 percent in Turkey‰Û according to the report.The World Bank report said the proportion of EU citizens between the ages of 20 and 24 with a high school diploma was 80 percent, while the same rate was 55 percent in Ankara, and 35 percent in the province of Kars (a city near the Russian boarder).  It noted that Turkey needed to have a higher proportion of high school graduates in order to compete with Europe and the rest of the world, noting that the EU‰Ûªs aim was to have 85 percent of its population age 22 and over be high school graduates by 2015.  It said Turkish parents contributed around half of the total cost of education for students in normal state high schools while very few of vocational high school students‰Ûª parents contributed.  Beyond this, it claimed that Turkey‰Ûªs vocational schools fail to address the needs of industry and the labor market.The system also does nothing to boost the quality of teachers, with educators facing a serious shortage of educational materials.  Schools are not made to answer for their students‰Ûª underperformance and have no autonomy.What Needs to be Done:  The report said Turkey needed a national education sector strategy, noting Turkey‰Ûªs future is linked to the educational standards of its workers.  Quality is key.The bank suggested setting annual targets for provinces, with the aim of ensuring that 80 percent of children graduate from high school by 2015.  It said huge investment needed to be made in the educational sector, with the average pupils-per-teacher ratio being decreased to between 20 and 25.High school education needs to be made compulsory, it said, with special emphasis being placed on the education of girls and poor children.  Schools need to be encouraged to increase their quality in incremental fashion.The education of teachers needs to be coordinated nationally, with a special assessment test being carried out to judge teachers‰Ûª quality.  Vocational schools need to educate students in accordance with the needs of the economy, with more mobility given to students to choose what subject they want to study.The report recommended a new, comprehensive OSS (high school graduation test) to show what students have learned and how capable they are in applying it.  The report also suggested that the state provide more incentives to the private sector for investing in education.The World Bank also asked Turkey to initiate the necessary policies immediately in order to train Turkish youth as future European citizens.  ‰ÛÏIn order to ensure that Turkish youth won‰Ûªt become the low wage earners of Europe, Turkey needs to act now‰ÛThe World Bank will also conduct a similar study on Turkish higher education in cooperation with the Turkish Ministry of Education, the Finance Ministry, Higher Educational Board (YOK) and the State Planning Organization (DPT.)Source:  Turkish Daily News, March 28, 2006For more information on the Turkish Educational sector, please contact:Inci CilogluU.S. Commercial ServiceIstanbul, TurkeyTel:  [90] (212) 335-9197Fax:  [90] (212) 335-9103E-Mail:  Inci.Ciloglu@mail.doc.govVisit www.csturkey.com - www.BuyUSA.gov </td>

He noted that India was about to make a $300 billion investment in its infrastructure, and added that the fact that there are four Turkish construction contractors operating in India is a clear indicator of India‰Ûªs market potential as a wholeImportance of University Industry Cooperation in Software:  India is a densely populated country with a high percentage of young people educated at world standards who work for relatively low wages.  These are cited among the reasons behind India‰Ûªs success in the software industry, and are part of the incentives India extends to investors.  International companies such as IBM, Microsoft and Fujitsu have research and development centers in India.  University-industry cooperation in the IT sector is crucial, as is the establishment of techno-parks, the DEIK officials emphasized.Source:  Turkish Daily News, May 2, 2006For more information on the Turkish Educational sector, please contact:Inci CilogluCommercial SpecialistU.S. Commercial ServiceIstanbul, TurkeyTel:  [90] (212) 335-9197Fax:  [90] (212) 335-9103E-Mail:  Inci,Ciloglu@mail.doc.govVisit www.csturkey.com - www.BuyUSA.gov </td>

<td> TURKEY:  15 New Universities to be Opened Throughout the CountryTurkish President Sezer has signed off on the plan to open 15 new universities throughout Turkey.  The Republic of Turkey‰Ûªs Higher Education Board (YOK), a secular-oriented institution, has given the green light for opening universities in rural areas so that students will not have to travel to urban areas for their education, but can be studying near their hometowns.  Although these universities will be weighted toward Koranic studies on the ‰ÛÏImam Hatip‰Û model (the Koran training schools are known as ‰ÛÏImam Hatip‰Û), it will still be an important financial advantage for the students not to have to leave their hometowns.   YOK will eventually appoint new deans for these universities and will be in the market for deans, university personnel and teachers.According to Law 2809, dated March 28, 2006, authored by the YOK, the new universities will be located at:Kastmonu (Kastamonu University), Duzce (Duzce University), Usak (Mehmet Arif Ersoy University), (Usak University), Rize (Rize University), Afyon (Kocatepe University), Thrace (Namik Kemal University), Erzincan (Erzincan University), Aksaray (Aksaray University), Giresun (Giresun University), Yozgat (Bozok University), Adiyaman (Adiyaman University), Corum (Hitit University), Ordu (Ordu University), and Amasya (Amasya University.)

He also stated that foreign universities would bring competition, quality, international experience, and success to Turkish higher education.  Turkish education suffers from problems of quality and of insufficient places for its high school graduates.  Sener cited various countries as examples of the concept of ‰ÛÏgathering all universities under one roof:‰Û  In Israel there are 30 foreign campuses, in Italy there is the American University of the World, and the 2nd John Hopkins University campus, the American University is located in Bulgaria, and Poland hosts the Academy of English.  In Ukraine there is the International University Prime, in the Netherlands, the United Nations University, in Belgium, Boston University, and in Egypt, the American University of Cairo.  Also India, Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, and China all have foreign university campuses.  Sener was asked if foreign universities will be governed by The Republic of Turkey‰Ûªs Higher Education Council (YOK) or not.  His answer was that such a system of governance could be arranged and details could be discussed; however, this project is just at its planning stage.  It will be discussed by the Board of Ministers and then it has to be approved by the Turkish Parliament.
